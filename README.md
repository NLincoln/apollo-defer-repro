# Apollo Defer Repro

This is to demonstrate some weird behavior with @defer and ReadableStream

# Getting Started

Open up 2 terminals, one for the `frontend` folder and another for the `backend` folder. In each of them run `yarn start`

View the app at http://localhost:3000

Open the console and look for errors.

If there are issues, try ramping up the length of either array in `backend/src/data.js`
